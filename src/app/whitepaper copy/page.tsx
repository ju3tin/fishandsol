               <span>I am Jordan, Founder of That Martini Guy &amp; Crypto Saving Expert. I was an early $BORG  investor and many Swissborg users found out about the business through myself. I believe in utility being the key to success in Crypto and this is how I identified so many top quality assets such as $BORG and added them to my own portfolio.</span></span>
                <p className="py-2">11 years of learning from other peoples mistakes have led me to create my own memecoin. Having witnessed hundreds of projects try and fail to have real world impact, real users and real utility I have devised a memecoin concept I believe will be successful.</p>
                <span className="p">The concept is simple and based on the following lessons I have learnt over my time in the industry. Most people in crypto do not use their Altcoins for their intended purpose. Most Altcoins are a vehicle for speculation rather than a vehicle for utility. Most founders' first ever experience of running a big company is whatever coin they launch in Web3 and most coins fail due to poor leadership and a lack of market understanding and experience. Most Web3 businesses that launch a coin use an ICO as a way to fund their business and most of the VCs that invest in these coins from day one sell on all the new users the business acquires, virtually guaranteeing failure by lack of positive sentiment.</span>
                <p className="pt-2">The industry has been infected by VC parasites and I am setting out to change this with a coin created for positive social impact with no VC investment.
                I have decided a memecoin is the right way to go, but FishNChips is not a memecoin in the traditional sense of “here is another dog coin that does nothing”. The purpose of a memecoin is to be a purely speculative asset. To date nobody has tried to make a memecoin that creates social good. This is something I am trying to change.</p>

$CHIPPY is the first ever Fish and Chips coin on earth. We set out to build an ecosystem that
rewards holders with free Fish and Chips every Friday and to date have given away over 2,500
portions of Fish and Chips.<br /></span>
<p className="my-4 text-[#9EFF00]">Problem</p>

<span className="p">
The cost of living crisis rumbles on with high inflation, wages that cannot match inflation, and a society getting poorer while a few select rich people get richer. With all that is going on in the world the Fish and Chips industry globally has been one of the hardest hit businesses. Once a
cheap meal for the working classes, it has become a luxury in most households with the
intended target market no longer able to afford this cuisine.</span>

Since 1971 the price of Wholesale White Fillet Fish is up from £0.53 to a staggering £19.53 per
KG, a shocking 3528% rise in price.</span>
<span className="p"><br />
To weigh this up against inflation the easiest metric we can take is gold. In 1971 the price of
1oz of gold was $300 and now the price is $2,312 (10 June 2024), an increase of 670%.
</span>
<span className="p"><br />
White Fillet Fish has outpaced inflation (based on the price of gold) by 426% since 1971. This
has had a dramatic effect on the health of the Fishing industry and has resulted in a constant
state of decline in the Fishing and Fish and Chips industries pricing most ordinary people out
of the market.
</span>
<span className="p"><br />
This creates more unemployment, more poverty and general societal decline.

            <p className="my-4 text-[#9EFF00]">Solution</p>

            
$CHIPPY Fish N Chips on SOLANA is part of the solution to fix the Fishing
industry by increasing sales of one of the tastiest and most popular meals on earth.
The premise is simple. We are increasing sales of Fish N Chips worldwide. This is benefitting the industry and giving a boost to the sector. We are giving an opportunity to our coin’s holders to receive $25 in $CHIPPY tokens every week if they purchase a portion of Fish N Chips.

This feeds the people and at the same time benefits the industry.

<p className="my-4 text-[#9EFF00]">Market Figures</p>

The total value of the memecoin industry is $57.1 billion. Still, not one of these coins does anything, has a use case or benefits society in any way.
The value of memecoins fluctuates significantly because of this lack of utility and of a reason to hold.

As somebody who found a lot of success during the Food DeFi craze of 2021 I believe this is
something that will come back.
Food DeFi was no different than memecoins, only if you staked the coin, you would recieve
more coins which encouraged people to buy off the market and lock up supply off market.
This, combined with an influx of new stakers, caused prices to rise significantly.

<p className="my-4 text-[#9EFF00]">Details on Token</p>

The Food DeFi model is somewhat flawed when the markets come down, because it allows for
significant APY on tokens which creates a lot of selling pressure.

By limiting token emissions to $25 per user we keep our supply under control.

Combined with regular buybacks, the $CHIPPY economy should not suffer from significant sell
offs as there are no whales; nobody sniped the launch and our holders are a strong community.

There is no huge supply entering the market and the largest wallet is the founders wallet which
is predominantly used to fund the token emissions and other operational costs.

If the price of $CHIPPY is at a $100m valuation then the token price is $0.10. At this price $25
is 250 tokens.

To be able to recieve free food every week users must hold 10,000 tokens.

The cost of 10,000 tokens at this price would be $1,000.

Per week, recieving $25 tokens back, if the price did not change it would take 40 weeks to
recoup the cost of the 10,000 token investment.

Naturally, though, everybody that buys $CHIPPY is likely to get 100% of their money back
given enough time.

        <div className="wrapper1">
            <div className="inner">

            Also, not every person claims their free food every week. So far we have found
only around 10% of holders claim their free food every week which reduces token
emissions significantly.

As the users in the ecosystem grow, the price of the coin rises faster than the
emissions schedule can emit, in theory creating an up-only trajectory for the ecosystem.

<p className="my-4 text-[#9EFF00]">Development Strategy</p>

Most memecoins fail as they lack a strategy for development. For us development has come
naturally with the goal of the project being social good. The larger the market cap, the more
food we give away. The more food we give away the more people tell each other about
$CHIPPY which brings in new holders and causes price appreciation and community growth.

We have done two in-person events to date and have plans for one in-person event every two
weeks in all areas across the world.



            </div>
                </div>
                </div>
                </section>


                <section id="witepaper-section5" className="active" style={{}}>
    <div id="container13" className="container default">
        <div className="wrapper1">
            <div className="inner">

            When giving away free food we naturally get a lot of questions. We have found that the local press tend to cover our events which gets us exposure to a lot more people than actually attend the event, increasing the size of our community.

We have also noticed we have a large effect on educating people how to buy and use Crypto with many people that attend our in person events not knowing anything about crypto, they learn about it and convert into holders.

We have found the most powerful effect to be the network effect because we have a positive
message than benefits people during the cost of living crisis allowing people that otherwise
potentially could not afford it the opportunity of a nice meal. For those than can afford they still enjoy being holders because like with any memecoin they are speculating on the community
gaining more users which would allow them to profit from price appreciation.

<p className="my-4 text-[#9EFF00]">NFTs</p>


Given the current climate on NFTs we believe there is a huge opportunity in the NFT space. The
Quality of NFTs has never been very good, the most popular NFTs have nice artwork and are
generally a yield baring asset.

We would like to implement this strategy by commissioning 9,999 NFTs to be made in the form
of a cute friendly fish. You would be able to stake the Fish + your Tokens in a portal to receive
your free chippy Friday rewards.

Under the current token model this has an interest rate of 200% APY, Certain fish would
increase the APY and increase the free chippy Friday rewards and as the token rises in price as
would the NFT as the rewards would also increase.

It would be great exercise in brand awareness as every chippy community member would set
their online profile picture to the NFT creating a large marking boost to the brand and pushing
its adoption.
The long term goal of doing this NFT would be to get plush toys made and distributed across supermarkets and toy stores globally. The the commission from the sale of these toys would go
to the holders of the NFTs again giving them value and passive income.

<p className="my-4 text-[#9EFF00]">Lans, Finances & Forecasts</p>

Going forward, the plan for $CHIPPY is to continue on the path we are on. What started as a
simple coin launched on PUMP.FUN with $0 in funding is turning into a mission to fix some of
society's problems, help everyone in the community eat well and support the Fish N Chip
industry.
