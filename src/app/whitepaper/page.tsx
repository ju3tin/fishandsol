               <span>I am Jordan, Founder of That Martini Guy &amp; Crypto Saving Expert. I was an early $BORG<br /> investor and many Swissborg users found out about the business through myself. I believe in<br /> utility being the key to success in Crypto and this is how I identified so many top quality assets<br /> such as $BORG and added them to my own portfolio.</span>
                </span>
                <span className="p">11 years of learning from other peoples mistakes have led me to create my own memecoin.<br /> Having witnessed hundreds of projects try and fail to have real world impact, real users and<br /> real utility I have devised a memecoin concept I believe will be successful.</span>
                <span className="p">The concept is simple and based on the following lessons I have learnt over my time in the<br /> industry. Most people in crypto do not use their Altcoins for their intended purpose. Most<br /> Altcoins are a vehicle for speculation rather than a vehicle for utility. Most founders’ first ever<br /> experience of running a big company is whatever coin they launch in Web3 and most coins fail<br /> due to poor leadership and a lack of market understanding and experience. Most Web3<br /> businesses that launch a coin use an ICO as a way to fund their business and most of the VCs<br /> that invest in these coins from day one sell on all the new users the business acquires, virtually<br /> guaranteeing failure by lack of positive sentiment.</span>
                <span className="p">The industry has been infected by VC parasites and I am setting out to change this with a coin<br /> created for positive social impact with no VC investment.</span>
                <span className="p">I have decided a memecoin is the right way to go, but FishNChips is not a memecoin in the<br /> traditional sense of “here is another dog coin that does nothing”. The purpose of a memecoin<br /> is to be a purely speculative asset. To date nobody has tried to make a memecoin that creates<br /> social good. This is something I am trying to change.</span>
